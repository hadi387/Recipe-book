        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, active dry yeast, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the warm water gradually to the dry ingredients, stirring continuously until you achieve a smooth and thick batter. The batter should be thicker than pancake batter but still pourable.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let the batter rest in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size and becomes frothy.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or a deep pot to 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li>Scoop spoonfuls of the batter and carefully drop them into the hot oil using your hands or a spoon. Fry in batches to avoid overcrowding.</li>
            <li>Fry the puff puff for about 2-3 minutes on each side or until they are golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove the fried puff puff from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
            <li>Serve the puff puff warm and enjoy as a tasty snack!</li>
