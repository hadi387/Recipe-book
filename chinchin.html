        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, salt, and baking powder.</li>
            <li>Add the softened unsalted butter to the dry ingredients and mix until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, beat the egg, then add the milk and vanilla extract. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough gently until it's smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into smaller portions and roll each portion into a thin sheet about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Using a knife or a pizza cutter, cut the rolled dough into small squares or rectangles.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or a deep pot to 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li>Carefully drop the cut dough into the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy, stirring occasionally to ensure even frying.</li>
            <li>Remove the fried chin chin from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
            <li>Allow the chin chin to cool completely before serving. They will become crunchier as they cool.</li>
            <li>Store the cooled chin chin in an airtight container for up to two weeks.</li>
        </ol>
